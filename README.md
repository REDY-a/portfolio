### Solution

create a PAT, personal access token
[github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/why-is-git-always-asking-for-my-password)
says:

```
Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods.
```

Creating a personal access token:
[create PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

See [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68781050) :

```
From your GitHub account, go to Settings
=>
Developer Settings => Personal Access Token
=>
Generate New Token (Give your password)
=>
Fillup the form => click Generate token
=>
Copy the generated Token, it will be something like

    ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta
```



[Access with Windows Credential Manager](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/message-support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal)

For Windows OS ⤴

```
Go to Credential Manager from Control Panel =>
Windows Credentials =>
find git:https://github.com =>
Edit =>
On Password replace with with your GitHub Personal Access Token =>
```
You are Done

If you don’t find git:https://github.com

```
Click on Add a generic credential
=>
Internet address will be git:https://github.com
and you need to type in your username and password will be your GitHub Personal Access Token
=>
Click Ok
```
and you are done

Two more tips:

- Open PAT permissions

- Use user name (not mail address) in Credential Manager
